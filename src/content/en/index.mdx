The theme of this year's conference is "Inspiration." We are collecting real stories from DDD practitioners from around the world and inviting them to share their journey of change, experiences, and growth.

The collection of topics includes but is not limited to:

→ Real cases from various industries, sharing both successful experiences and lessons learned.

→ Transformation and impact on team collaboration and organizational culture.

→ Practical application of DDD strategies and tactics.

→ Architecture design and transitioning legacy systems.

→ On-site programming.

→ Integrating DDD with other topics in practical work, e.g., Agile, DevOps, testing, UX, and other fields.
